Welcome!

The proposed task solution contains a number of .NET Core projects:

1) PhoneService project (class library)
contains core task functionality, that can be used with any frontend.
The main entry point is PhoneService class implementing IPhoneService interface.
PhoneService requires a number of customization parameters to be supplied.
When created, it runs data update cycle, and fires the corresponding update events.
A customer (usually frontend code) may handle these events and get the data.

2) PhoneServiceHost project (web-host executable)
is a host project for both Web API to get JSON data, and a user Web interface.
It uses PhoneService class instance in order to get the data to display.
Since the data provider pushes the notifications, the UI is able to easily
update its content almost the same time using SignalR library.

3) Tests/PhoneService.UnitTests project (test class library)
is PhoneService's core functionality unit test container.
The tests are devided into classes by the target testing classtypes.
PhoneService.dll code is 100% unit test covered.

4) Tests/PhoneService.IntegrationTests project (test class library)
features the system's Web API service integration tests.
Its result is the complete configured solution behavior verification
from the legacy data source to the Web API generated JSON content.
